# Modiin Bus Data

Modiin Bus relies of route data to provide value to its users. Rather than creating structured datasets inside each Modiin Bus repo, I decided to separate the data out into this repo.

Going forward, the Modiin Bus site will reference data either directly from this repo or through a related database (depending on what makes the most sense at the time).

Feedback on the most effective data model is most welcome!
